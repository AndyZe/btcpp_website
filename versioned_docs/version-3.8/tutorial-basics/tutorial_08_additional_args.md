# Pass additional arguments to your Nodes

In every single example we explored so far, we were "forced" to provide a
constructor with the following signature

``` cpp
MyCustomNode(const std::string& name, const NodeConfiguration& config);

```

In some cases, it is desirable to pass 
additional arguments, parameters, pointers, references, etc,
to the constructor of our class.

:::caution
Some people use blackboards to do that. **Don't**.
:::

We will just use the word _"arguments"_ for the rest of the tutorial.

Even if, theoretically, these arguments **could** be passed using Input Ports,
that would be the wrong way to do it if:

- The arguments are known at _deployment-time_ (when building the tree).
- The arguments don't change at _run-time_.
- The arguments don't need to be set from the XML.

If all these conditions are met, using ports or the blackboard is highly discouraged.

## Add arguments to your constructor (recommended)

Consider the following custom node called **Action_A**.

We want to pass two additional arguments; they can be arbitrarily complex objects,
you are not limited to built-in types.

``` cpp
// Action_A has a different constructor than the default one.
class Action_A: public SyncActionNode
{

public:
    // additional arguments passed to the constructor
    Action_A(const std::string& name, const NodeConfiguration& config,
             int arg_int, std::string arg_str):
        SyncActionNode(name, config),
        _arg1(arg_int),
        _arg2(arg_str) {}

    // this example doesn't require any port
    static PortsList providedPorts() { return {}; }

    // tick() can access the private members
    NodeStatus tick() override;

private:
    int _arg1;
    std::string _arg2;
};
```

To register this node and passing the known arguments:

``` cpp
BT::BehaviorTreeFactory factory;

// A node builder is a functor that creates a std::unique_ptr<TreeNode>.
// Using lambdas or std::bind, we can easily "inject" additional arguments.
BT::NodeBuilder builder_A =
   [](const std::string& name, const NodeConfiguration& config)
{
    return std::make_unique<Action_A>(name, config, 42, "hello world");
};

// BehaviorTreeFactory::registerBuilder is a more general way to
// register a custom node.
factory.registerBuilder<Action_A>("Action_A", builder_A);
```

## Use an "initialize" method

If, for any reason, you need to pass different values to the
individual instances of a Node type, you may want to consider this other pattern:


``` cpp
class Action_B: public SyncActionNode
{

public:
    // The constructor looks as usual.
    Action_B(const std::string& name, const NodeConfiguration& config):
        SyncActionNode(name, config) {}

    // We want this method to be called ONCE and BEFORE the first tick()
    void initialize(int arg_int, const std::string& arg_str)
    {
        _arg1 = arg_int;
        _arg2 = arg_str;
    }

    // this example doesn't require any port
    static PortsList providedPorts() { return {}; }

    // tick() can access the private members
    NodeStatus tick() override;

private:
    int _arg1;
    std::string _arg2;
};
```

The way we register and initialize Action_B is different:

``` cpp
BT::BehaviorTreeFactory factory;

// Register as usual, but we still need to initialize
factory.registerNodeType<Action_B>("Action_B");

// Create the whole tree. Instances of Action_B are not initialized yet
auto tree = factory.createTreeFromText(xml_text);

// Apply the visitor to ALL the nodes of the tree 
auto visitor = [](TreeNode* node)
{
  if (auto action_B_node = dynamic_cast<Action_B*>(node))
  {
    action_B_node->initialize(69, "interesting_value");
  }
};

// Apply the visitor to ALL the nodes of the tree
tree.applyVisitor(visitor);
```
